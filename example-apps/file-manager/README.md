# File Manager HTTP API Server

The File Manager API allows you to perform basic file management operations using AWS SDK for Python [Boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/). It supports uploading files, listing files, and deleting files in a specified S3 bucket. Your files are stored in AIOZ W3S Storage.

The application is developed using the Python programming language and the API is built using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework.

## âš  Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AIOZ W3S account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AIOZ W3S account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies and start the server. Here's how:

```bash
poetry install
```

You config your environment variables in `.env` file. You can copy from `.env.example` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, you can start the server by running:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app
```
